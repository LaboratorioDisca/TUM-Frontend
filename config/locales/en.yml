    history:
      subtitle: "Inception"
      content_one: "This project is built upon the work done at the Departamento de Ingeniería de Sistemas Computacionales y Automatización (DISCA) at IIMAS with the goal of developing and implementing a real time vehícle tracking system for the pumabús system."
      content_two: "It was considered a good idea for the benefits to the campus community, that pumabús frequent users could access the real-time location of any pumabús; thus, in the first months of this year we started the development of the platform which we are now presenting and which will be available for phones with iOS and Android operating systems, as well as modern Web browser clients."
    future:
      subtitle: "Future plans"
      content_one: "The UNAM main campus is an ideal space for innovation around common well issues. As the campus is like a micro-city, it results interesting to be able to implement and test bleeding edge technologies for solving campus-wide issues which can later be implemented outside the campus at a bigger scale."
      content_two: "On many cities around the globe - mainly on european cities - the governments are investing huge amounts of resources on the improvement of urban mobility through good public transportation infraestructure, with the aid of areas of study such as ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems)."
      content_three: "This project integrates technologies capable of improving the public transportation system at the UNAM campus, which can eventually get scaled for public transportation services in the Mexico's main cities and even on cities outside the country."
      todos: "Some points on which this project can be improved: "
      ideas: 
        one: "Improve the mechanisms for getting the real-time location of vehicles."
        two: "Explore alternatives such as <i>crowdsourcing</i> the vehicles location making use of specialized hardware."
        three: "Integrate aditional sensors to each vehicle for getting richer information that can be useful for the user."
        four: "Develop a wayfinding application allowing the use to retrieve optimal shortest paths between two points."
        five: "Integrate a robust technology solution for cities who want to improve it's public transportation systems on behalf of their users."
